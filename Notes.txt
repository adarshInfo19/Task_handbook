Understanding of the files:

lambda.py -> deployed code on AWS lambda with the dependency of boto3 (dependency resolved through AWS layer)

get_data_from_greytHR -> script for getting the data from greytHR and after creation of file that data will written in that file

employee_data.json -> generated file by get_data_from_greytHR and it contains all the data of employees 

main.py -> from where we trigger the lambda function 

get_data_s3 -> getting the uploaded data from s3


Improvement :

- consider the latest file of sending_data_api_gateway , in this file first we fetch the data then make .json file after that through the api gateway we are triggering the aws lambda and in the lambda we have code to push the file into s3
( we attached aws lambda to api gateway )
